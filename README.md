# Ionic starter project for visual studio 2015


The purpose of this project is to create a re-usable template for Ionic app development using Visual Studio 2015 as the IDE.

There is already a [template for Visual Studio](http://blog.ionic.io/announcing-ionic-templates-for-visual-studio/). This project is based on the creation of an [Ionic application](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) within a visual studio project so that it is more disconnected from VS and all the command line utilities for Ionic, Bower, Gulp, SASS etc are in place.  

The project is configured to use [TypeScript Definition manager for DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd) so running 'tsd update -so' from the 'ionic-starter' directory will add the required definition files.
